# How to test

## Minitest test helpers

ActiveModelSerializers provides a `assert_response_schema` method to be used on your controller tests to
assert the response against a [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org/). Let's take
a look in a example.

```ruby
class PostsController < ApplicationController
  def show
    @post = Post.find(params[:id])

    render json: @post
  end
end
```

To test the `posts#show` response of this controller we need to create a file in
`test/support/schemas/posts/show.json` the helper uses a convention to the name
of the file.

This file is a JSON Schema representation of our response.

```json
{
  "properties": {
    "title" : { "type" : "string" },
    "content" : { "type" : "string" }
  }
}
```

With all in place we can go to our test and use the helper.

```ruby
class PostsControllerTest < ActionController::TestCase
  test "should render right response" do
    get :index
    assert_response_schema
  end
end
```

### Load a custom schema

If we need to use other schema, for example when we have a namespaced API that
shows the same response, we can pass the path of the schema.

```ruby
module V1
  class PostsController < ApplicationController
    def show
      @post = Post.find(params[:id])

      render json: @post
    end
  end
end
```

```ruby
class V1::PostsControllerTest < ActionController::TestCase
  test "should render right response" do
    get :index
    assert_response_schema('posts/show.json')
  end
end
```
### Change the schema path

By default all schemas are created at `test/support/schemas` if we are using
RSpec for example we can change this to `spec/support/schemas` defining the
default schema path in a initializer.

```ruby
ActiveModelSerializers.config.schema_path = 'spec/support/schemas'
```

### Using with the Herokuâ€™s JSON Schema-based tools

To use the test helper with the [prmd](https://github.com/interagent/prmd) and
[committee](https://github.com/interagent/committee).

We need to change the schema path to the recommended by prmd:

```ruby
ActiveModelSerializers.config.schema_path = 'docs/schema/schemata'
```

We also need to structure our schemata according to Heroku's conventions
(e.g. including
[required metadata](https://github.com/interagent/prmd/blob/master/docs/schemata.md#meta-data)
and [links](https://github.com/interagent/prmd/blob/master/docs/schemata.md#links).
